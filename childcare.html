        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="intro">
            <img src="/images/FDCF/Child Care Hero.png" alt="Need to remember to fix all of these alts...">

            <p>I am not the ideal target user, but even I get overwhelmed trying to navigate the FDCF website's Child Care section. I can only imagine how a parent or guardian of a child must feel. In two weeks, two designers and I tackled redesigning the Child Care section of the FDCF's website.</p>

            <p>Sure, my team and I had problems using the website and detected some usability issues, but how do parents and guardians feel about the website as it existed? What troubles are they specifically having with the Child Care section of the website?</p>

            <p>To answer these questions, we used the following process:</p>

            <img src="/images/FDCF/Design Process - FDCF.png" alt="Seriously need to fix these alts...">

            <p>We started off our project by conducting user research and annotating the website with usability issues that we found.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- User Research -->
        <div class="userResearch">
            <div class="caseHeading">
                <h3>User Research</h3>
            </div>

            <!-- Redlining -->
            <p>While my other team members were forming questions to hone in on the user we were designing for, I completed an evaluation of the FDCF's website to highlight usability issues that I found with the site.</p>

            <p>I should note that the Child Care section actually has two kinds of users: families/guardians of children and childcare providers. Though the Child Care section is mainly aimed towards childcare providers, we focused on redesigning the childcare searching process for families and guardians of children due to our limited time frame.</p>

            <p>For this reason, my evaluation of the website was mainly focused on the childcare search process.</p>

            <div class="ccRedlining">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/Redlining CC Home.png" alt="Must...fix...alts...">

                <p class="caption">My evaluation of the homepage. The main issues I found were related to the navigation and organization of the page.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Starting with the Child Care section's home page, I could find a childcare provider in three ways:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>using the search box</li>

                <li>selecting "Provider Search" in the green "For Families" box</li>

                <li>selecting "More Information >>" under the "Provider Search" card</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I found the search box method easy to use and straightforward, but I did not realize that "Provider Search" in the "For Families" box was a link until I had hovered over it. I also thought that I had to click "More Options >>" to select "Provider Search".</p>

            <div class="ccLinks">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/FDCF - Links don't look like links.png" alt="If you're reading this, please send an email yelling at me to fix these alts">

                <p class="caption">The "Provider Search" link in the above dashed box is the same font and style as regular text in the below dashed box</p>
            </div>

            <p>Actually, on my first visit to this home page, I had scrolled down to the mass of cards below the three colored boxes since I thought all three of these colored boxes were informational in nature due to the bolded, unclickable information in the red “Contact Us” box.</p>

            <div class="ccColoredTrio">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/FDCF - Three main boxes aren't all content information.png" alt="...">

                <p class="caption">Since the "Training and Registry Login" link was underlined in the far right dashed box and the "Contact Us" box did not contain any links, I did not believe "Provider Search" to be a link</p>
            </div>

            <p>I immediately felt overwhelmed when the mass of cards at the bottom of the home page greeted me. Due to all of the cards' proximity to each other and varying sizes, I thought that these cards were placed randomly. Only after a few minutes did I realize that each column of cards was organized according to the topic of the colored card that they were under.</p>

            <div class="ccDownIcon">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/FDCF - See the columns.png" alt="......">

                <p class="caption">Although the blue down arrow icon helps indicate the relationship between the top three boxes and the columns of cards below, this relationship is not immediately obvious.</p>
            </div>

            <p>We found that our users, a group of five parents, also had similar issues with the home page as I had found.</p>

            <div class="userQuotes">
                <p class="quote"><i>"What's going on here? It's like a huge jungle of options to choose from..."</i> - Mike, 35</p>

                <p class="quote"><i>"I really don't know what is happening with all these options down here. They seem very randomly placed." </i>- Liz, 32</p>
            </div>

            <!-- User Persona -->
            <p>Now that we knew what issues users were having with the website and more information about them thanks to user testing, we had a clearer vision of our target persona.</p>

            <div class="ccPersona">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/FDCF - User Persona.png" alt=".........">
            </div>

            <p>Meet Brianna Mitchell. She’s the mother of Rachael and Ian, two elementary school children, who she loves dearly, but cannot provide care for after school due to her demanding job as a registered nurse. Worn out from a busy day of work, Brianna needs to easily find a childcare provider that caters to both her needs and her children's.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Definition -->
        <div class="definition">
            <div class="caseHeading">
                <h3>Definition</h3>
            </div>

            <p>How could we meet Brianna’s needs with a new and improved Child Care website? My teammates defined Brianna’s specific problem:</p>

            <p>There are many different places available in any local area in Florida that offer childcare. Although the childcare facilities must follow laws and regulations, each facility is different in their approach. Searching for a childcare facility is difficult for people who may be seeking to meet specific needs for their families, and it is also hard to find information about specific places using the current Florida Department of Children and Family Services website.</p>

            <p><b>How might we redesign the FDCF’s Child Care section of their website so that parents and guardians can easily and quickly find the right childcare provider that fits within their constraints?</b></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Ideation -->
        <div class="ideation">
            <div class="caseHeading">
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
            </div>

            <!-- User Scenario -->
            <p>With Brianna’s needs and emotions in mind, I envisioned what her experience using the FCDF’s website to find a childcare provider would be like.</p>

            <div class="ccUserScenario">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/FDCF - User Scenario.png" alt="............">
            </div>

            <!-- User Flow -->
            <p>As outlined in the above scenario, the main goal of our redesign would be to connect Brianna to a childcare provider. With this goal in mind, I created a user flow detailing Brianna's journey from the Child Care section's home page to a childcare provider's page.</p>

            <div class="ccUserFlowOne">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/First user flow version.png" alt="................">

                <p class="caption">One of our first user flows. We revised this flow to only include the task of using the search bar on the home page to search for a childcare provider due to our limited time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ccUserFlowTwo">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/Second user flow version.png" alt="No alt, no caption either, huh?">
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Prototype -->
        <div class="prototype">
            <div class="caseHeading">
                <h3>Prototype</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Once our user flow was finalized, my team and I created wireframes of the website pages together to test on our users.</p>

            <div class="ccfirstSearch">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/First CC Provider Results.png" alt="Process pic 1">

                <p class="caption">Our first version of the search results page after Brianna searches for a specific childcare provider. We needed to fix the navigation so that Brianna knew where she was in the Child Care section of this website.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ccSecondSearch">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/Provider Search v2.png" alt="">

                <p class="caption">Our final wireframe has main navigation and side navigation that shows where Brianna is in the Child Care section of the website. Based on user feedback, we also provided breadcrumbs to indicate location on the website.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Style Guide -->
            <p>While we were working on our wireframes, we had been gathering UI inspiration from the designs of other child care websites. We chose the bright and friendly rainbow colors of children’s playing blocks to use for our redesign for the welcoming feelings that they induced.</p>

            <div class="ccStyle">
                <img src="/images/FDCF/FDCF - Style Guide.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <!-- Final Prototype -->
            <p>Once we had fixed our wireframes, we applied our style guide to them to create our hi-fi clickable prototype.</p>

            <div class="ccPrototypes">
                <div class="ccprototype">
                    <img src="/images/FDCF/Version 1 Child Care Home – 2.png" alt="Remember to replace later!">

                    <p class="caption">Final clickable prototype in Adobe XD</p>
                </div>

                <div class="ccprototype">
                    <img src="/images/FDCF/Version 1 Child Care Home – 2.png" alt="Remember to replace with iframe!">

                    <p class="caption">Final coded prototype</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Reflection -->
        <div class="reflection">
            <div class="caseHeading">
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Handling navigation for even a subsection of such a large site was no easy matter. We simplified the navigation to fit Brianna’s needs for finding a childcare provider, but for the actual website, we would have to consider modifying the navigation while being mindful of other users, who are mainly childcare providers. With more time, my team and I could have created another persona for a childcare provider and redesigned the Child Care section with them in mind.</p>

            <p>Another challenge that I found particularly difficult was creating the user flow. Since we only had a couple of weeks to make both a clickable and a coded prototype, we could not add other tasks that Brianna could do besides search for a childcare provider, such as filtering for a provider based on her preferences. With more time and knowledge about how to code forms for the website, my team and I could have included more search features into the final coded prototype to help Brianna find the right childcare provider.</p>
