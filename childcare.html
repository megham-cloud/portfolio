                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I am not the ideal target user, but I get overwhelmed trying to navigate the FDCF's Child Care section. I can only imagine how a parent or guardian of a child must feel. In two weeks, two designers and I tackled redesigning the Child Care section of the FDCF's website.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Sure, my team and I had problems using the website and detected some usability issues, but how do parents and guardians feel about the website as it existed? What troubles are they specifically having with the Child Care section of the website?</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">To answer these questions, we used the following process:</p>

                <img class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 imageNoCaption" src="/portfolio/images/FDCF/design_process___fdcf.svg" alt="Diagram of my design process: User Research, Defining a Problem, Ideating Solutions, Creating Prototypes, and Testing Prototypes">

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">We started our project by conducting user research and annotating the website with usability issues we found.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">While my other team members were forming questions to hone in on the user we were designing for, I completed an evaluation of the FDCF's website to highlight usability issues that I found with the site.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I should note that the Child Care section has two kinds of users: families/guardians of children and childcare providers. Though the Child Care section is focused primarily on childcare providers, we focused on redesigning the childcare searching process for families and guardians of children due to our limited time frame.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">For this reason, my evaluation was mainly focused on the childcare search process.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">With the Child Care section's home page, I could find a childcare provider in three ways:</p>

                <ol class="caseList col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
                    <li>using the search box</li>

                    <li>selecting "Provider Search" in the green "For Families" box</li>

                    <li>selecting "More Information >>" under the "Provider Search" card</li>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I found the search box method straightforward, but I did not realize that "Provider Search" in the "For Families" box was a link until I had hovered over it. I also thought that I had to click "More Options >>" to select "Provider Search".</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Actually, on my first visit to this home page, I had scrolled down to the mass of cards below the three colored boxes since I thought all three of these colored boxes were informational due to the bolded, unclickable information in the red "Contact Us" box.</p>

                <p class="caption col-10 col-lg-8">Since the "Training and Registry Login" link was underlined in the far right dashed box and the "Contact Us" box did not contain any links, I did not believe "Provider Search" to be a link.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I immediately felt overwhelmed when the mass of cards at the bottom of the home page greeted me. Due to the proximity and varying sizes of the cards, I thought that the cards' placement was random. It took me a few minutes to realize that each column of cards followed the topic of the colored card that they were under.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">While we were working on our wireframes, we gathered UI inspiration from the designs of other child care websites.

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">As a test for our coding knowledge and to build our understanding of what developers deal with when they receive our designs, we coded part of our hi-fi prototype. We only coded three pages due to time constraints and our limited coding knowledge; this meant not coding any forms or tables.</p>
                
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">With these limitations in place, we chose to code the finding of a childcare provider using the search box on the home page. The three pages we would have to code are the home page, search results page, and the synopsis page for the childcare provider. I tackled the home page and the synopsis page while my teammate handled the search results page. You can find the code we wrote here on Github.</p>
                
                <h4 class="headline col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2" id="ccProblems">What problems did we face while coding?</h4>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Even with the help of Bootstrap's intuitive framework, we struggled with creating the website. The most difficult part of the coding process was understanding how Github Pages operates. When we first published our website, Github would not recognize our CSS file.</p>
                
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Previously, to apply the CSS styling, we had written the following in the head of our HTML code:</p>
                
                <pre class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2"><code>&lt;link&gt; href="/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></pre>
                
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">This above code resulted in the following page:</p>
            </div>    
            
            <!-- Bare HTML page -->
            <div class="ccJustHTML row d-flex justify-content-evenly">
                <img class="col-10 col-lg-8" src="" alt="The Child Care section's home page without any images or styling displayed. Only the headings and text are visible.">

                <p class="caption col-10 col-lg-8">Only the headings and text of our home page is visible since the CSS is not linked properly.</p>
            </div>            
            
            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">After checking our code by using Google Chrome's DevTools, we realized that the issue was how we referenced the links to the CSS file in our HTML code. Changing the CSS styling amounted to understanding Github's way of recognizing file structure.</p>
                
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">We thought that since our CSS folder lives in the same child-care-repo folder as our HTML pages, Github can find our CSS folder. However, since Github starts looking for sources starting from megham-cloud.github.io, Github wanted the CSS folder explicitly listed under the child-care-repo folder in the code.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Showing Chrome's DevTools -->
            <div class="ccDevTools row d-flex justify-content-evenly">

                <p class="caption col-10 col-lg-8">Github thinks it will find our css folder in the megham-cloud.github.io folder, but Github needs to go into the child-care-repo folder before accessing our css folder.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">To fix our issue, we must have the following code in the head instead:</p>
                
                <pre class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2"><code>&lt;link&gt; href="/child-care-repo/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></pre>
                
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Now we have the CSS styling applied:</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- CSS styling fixed! -->
            <div class="ccCSSFixed row d-flex justify-content-evenly">
                <img class="col-10 col-lg-8" src="" alt="The Child Care section's home page with images and styling displayed">
                
                <p class="caption col-10 col-lg-8">Now all styling can be visible on the home page!</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Though this may seem like a simple error, it was so easy to overlook the solution. We spent so much time pulling our hair out only to find the problem in a matter of minutes. I cannot begin to imagine how much frustration developers must feel when they encounter a roadblock, and I have so much respect for those that persevere until they find a way around it.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Handling navigation for even a subsection of such a large site was no easy matter. Though we simplified the navigation to fit Brianna’s needs for finding a childcare provider, for the actual website, we would have to consider modifying the navigation while being mindful of other users, who are mainly childcare providers. With more time, my team and I could have created another persona for a childcare provider and redesigned the Child Care section with them in mind.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Another challenge that I found particularly difficult was creating the user flow. Since we only had a couple of weeks to make both a clickable and a coded prototype, we could not add other tasks that Brianna could do besides search for a childcare provider, such as filtering for a provider based on her preferences. With more time and knowledge about coding forms for the website, my team and I could have included more search features into the final coded prototype to help Brianna find the right childcare provider.</p>
