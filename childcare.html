            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I am not the ideal target user, but even I get overwhelmed trying to navigate the FDCF website's Child Care section. I can only imagine how a parent or guardian of a child must feel. In two weeks, two designers and I tackled redesigning the Child Care section of the FDCF's website.</p>

                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Sure, my team and I had problems using the website and detected some usability issues, but how do parents and guardians feel about the website as it existed? What troubles are they specifically having with the Child Care section of the website?</p>

                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">To answer these questions, we used the following process:</p>

                <img class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 imageNoCaption" src="/images/FDCF/Design Process - FDCF.png" alt="Seriously need to fix these alts...">

                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">We started off our project by conducting user research and annotating the website with usability issues that we found.</p>
            </div>

        </div>



        <!-- User Research -->

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">While my other team members were forming questions to hone in on the user we were designing for, I completed an evaluation of the FDCF's website to highlight usability issues that I found with the site.</p>

                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I should note that the Child Care section actually has two kinds of users: families/guardians of children and childcare providers. Though the Child Care section is mainly aimed towards childcare providers, we focused on redesigning the childcare searching process for families and guardians of children due to our limited time frame.</p>

                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">For this reason, my evaluation of the website was mainly focused on the childcare search process.</p>

                <p class="caption">My evaluation of the homepage. The main issues I found were related to the navigation and organization of the page.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Starting with the Child Care section's home page, I could find a childcare provider in three ways:</p>

                <ol class="caseList col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
                    <li>using the search box</li>

                    <li>selecting "Provider Search" in the green "For Families" box</li>

                    <li>selecting "More Information >>" under the "Provider Search" card</li>
                </ol>    
                
                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I found the search box method easy to use and straightforward, but I did not realize that "Provider Search" in the "For Families" box was a link until I had hovered over it. I also thought that I had to click "More Options >>" to select "Provider Search".</p>                
            </div>

            <div class="ccLinks row justify-content-evenly">

                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Actually, on my first visit to this home page, I had scrolled down to the mass of cards below the three colored boxes since I thought all three of these colored boxes were informational in nature due to the bolded, unclickable information in the red “Contact Us” box.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ccColoredTrio row justify-content-evenly">

                <p class="caption col-lg-8">Since the "Training and Registry Login" link was underlined in the far right dashed box and the "Contact Us" box did not contain any links, I did not believe "Provider Search" to be a link</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I immediately felt overwhelmed when the mass of cards at the bottom of the home page greeted me. Due to all of the cards' proximity to each other and varying sizes, I thought that these cards were placed randomly. Only after a few minutes did I realize that each column of cards was organized according to the topic of the colored card that they were under.</p>

Although the childcare facilities must follow laws and regulations, each facility is different in their approach. Searching for a childcare facility is difficult for people who may be seeking to meet specific needs for their families, and it is also hard to find information about specific places using the current Florida Department of Children and Family Services website.</p>

                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Handling navigation for even a subsection of such a large site was no easy matter. We simplified the navigation to fit Brianna’s needs for finding a childcare provider, but for the actual website, we would have to consider modifying the navigation while being mindful of other users, who are mainly childcare providers. With more time, my team and I could have created another persona for a childcare provider and redesigned the Child Care section with them in mind.</p>

                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Another challenge that I found particularly difficult was creating the user flow. Since we only had a couple of weeks to make both a clickable and a coded prototype, we could not add other tasks that Brianna could do besides search for a childcare provider, such as filtering for a provider based on her preferences. With more time and knowledge about how to code forms for the website, my team and I could have included more search features into the final coded prototype to help Brianna find the right childcare provider.</p>
