                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Traveling has been on my mind shortly since I started quarantining at home, so I wanted to design a new travel app to help fellow travelers easily plan their travels after the pandemic ends. I will use the following process to design this app in four weeks (as this was my first design project, I followed this process very linearly):</p>

                <img class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 imageNoCaption" src="/portfolio/images/IFT/Design Process - IFT.png" alt="A diagram showing the design process I followed. The process begins with user research, which is represented by an icon of a person, to defining a problem, which is represented by a magnifying glass icon, to ideating a solution, represented by a lightbulb icon, to prototyping, represented by a mobile phone icon, and finally, to testing, which is represented by an icon of a comment bubble with ellipses in it.">

                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">First, I needed to understand what troubles and emotions travelers were having during their planning process by conducting user interviews. I also wanted to ask about what apps or tools they were using for planning, so I could get an idea of what competitor travel apps were doing right and places where they could improve.</p>

                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">With four weeks to complete my design, I took off to do user research.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">From interviewing five travelers, who were all college age students in their early 20’s, I found that they had a common need of wanting to visit unique, local-recommended places in order to avoid the same three to ten popular tourist attractions that were often over-hyped on the internet. Four out of five of my travelers planned trips based on word-of-mouth from other tourists who had been to the area or by asking locals, such as Airbnb hosts, what destinations they recommended. Most of my travelers wished that they could have planned their travels to be more efficient about transportation time between tourist spots.</p>

                <p class="quote col-lg-3 text-center"><i>“The beach that we went to did not seem to live up to the reviews...I think the reviews kind of overhyped the beach. It took, like, two hours to get there.”</i>- Nam, 22</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I also surveyed 17 travelers to learn about their travel planning pains and planning tools that they used. The survey results reveal that the most frustrating pain point is paying for expensive tourist attractions. Most of the people surveyed used Google Maps, Reddit, and Yelp in order to plan their trips.</p>

                <h1>The Informed Traveler: Mobile App Design</h1>
                <p>A one-stop app for finding unique traveling experiences</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Traveling can be a very rewarding experience, even lifechanging, but planning for meaningful travels are difficult when the top search results for travel destinations are often populated by expensive, well known places.
                    <br><br>The Informed Traveler is a mobile travel app that allows travelers to create travel plans by selecting from unique traveling destinations. Travelers can inform their selection of a travel destination by reading reviews from locals in that area and travelers who have been to that destination.</p>

        <!-- The Problem -->
        <!-- <div class="ift-problem col-7">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I observed that travelers were having trouble and spending too much time picking unique locations to
                visit for
                their travels. These locations tended to be overpriced and the same basic tourist experience recommended
                by
                almost every travelling website. How might I create a travel planning app so that travelers can easily
                and
                quickly find authentic experiences that fit within their budget and vacation time?</p>
            <img src="" alt="">

        <!-- User Research -->
        <!-- <div class="ift-user ift-section">
            <h3>User Research</h3>

            <p>In order to create a travel planning app to meet travelers’ needs, I first needed to conduct more research through user interviews and a survey in order to determine what travelers currently found painful about the travel planning process and how they felt about travel planning tools that they were already using.</p>

            <h4>Survey Results</h4>
            <img class="survey-image" src="/images/IFT/IFT-pain-survey.PNG" alt="Travel Planning Pains Results">

            <p>I want you to meet Miriam Garcia, a sharp and highly individualistic traveler, who was born from the interview and survey results. Miriam just received her Master’s degree and wishes to celebrate by traveling abroad. Miriam’s previous experience with travel planning is searching for unique travel destinations only to find overpriced tourist traps, so she is understandably frustrated. It's time for her to easily find and plan an authentic traveling experience.</p>
            <h4>User Persona: Miriam Garcia</h4>
            <img src="/images/IFT/IFT-user-persona.PNG" alt="Miriam Garcia">

            <br><br>
            <p>By carefully considering my targeted users and their needs through Miriam, I can form the problem that my travel app must solve.</p>
        </div> -->

        <!-- Definition -->
        <!-- <div class="ift-definition ift-section">
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>Miriam can easily plan which stops she wishes to make on her trips with the aid of search engines and reviews online, but only the most popular tourist attractions show up in the results or are recommended by other travelers, which causes Miriam great frustration. I need to give Miriam an easier way to view authentic, local-approved traveling experiences without having to dig through the internet to find them.</p>

        <!-- Ideation -->
        <!-- <div class="ift-ideation ift-section">
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>Now that I have formed Miriam’s problem into an actionable statement, I can begin to come up with ideas for a solution. I organized potential ideas that I had based on what I thought would have the greatest impact on the user and would fit into the amount of time that I had given myself to design the app. I decided on designing a review system for travel destinations as well as a way to filter travel destinations by personal preferences</p>

            <p>With a better sense of what my app should be able to provide to my users, I mapped out the journey that Miriam will take throughout The Informed Traveler. Miriam is searching for destinations in Costa Rica to visit, but finds that she is finding the same top ten popular locations to visit. She finds an ad for The Informed Traveler and decides to give it a try. Miriam finds that she can easily plan a trip filled with authentic experiences thanks to The Informed Traveler.</p>

        <!-- Prototyping & Testing -->
        <!-- <div class="ift-proto-test ift-section">
            <h3>Prototyping & Testing</h3>
            <p>Taking the trip I had imagined Miriam would take through The Informed Traveler, I created a user flow of all the actions that users can take. These actions are the features that I had prioritized: interacting with a review system and sorting authentic travel experiences by personal preference.</p>
            <h4>User Flow</h4>
            <iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/o9J_kl3HOkk=/?moveToViewport=-8780,-5009,6418,2310" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" allowFullScreen></iframe>


            <p>After I had my user flow completed, I created wireframes for The Informed Traveler to ensure that my app was easy to navigate and clear to use.</p>
            <h4>Digital Wireframes</h4>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                <iframe width="414" height="736" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/07c2bbe6-0846-425d-983d-36a1f6a41d69-5291/?fullscreen" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>After testing my wireframes on five users, I found that users needed to distinguish the personal preferences filter from other buttons and that favorable reviews left by locals needed to be highlighted from reviews left by travelers.</p>

            <br><br>

            <h4>Analyzing feedback to Prioritizing Fixes</h4>
            <iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/o9J_knct1Qs=/?moveToViewport=25374,-5887,1945,2716" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" allowFullScreen></iframe>

            <p>Using this feedback, I iterated on my user flow.</p>

            <p>I updated my wireframes using the feedback I had received and also applied some images to give my app a more polished look. What resulted is the following hi-fi prototype:</p>
