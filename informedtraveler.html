                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Traveling has been on my mind shortly since I started quarantining at home, so I wanted to design a new mobile app to help fellow travelers easily plan their travels after the pandemic ends. I will use the following process to design this app in four weeks (as this was my first design project, I followed this process very linearly):</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">First, I needed to understand what troubles and emotions travelers were having during their planning process by conducting user interviews. I also wanted to ask them about what travel planning apps or tools they were using to understand what competitor travel apps were doing right and where they could improve.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">With four weeks on the clock, I took off to do user research.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I checked that my interviewees had at least one traveling experience in the past couple of years since I wanted to understand how today’s travelers planned.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">From interviewing five travelers, who were all college-age students in their early 20’s, I learned that they had a common need of visiting unique, local-recommended places. Further questioning revealed that they wanted to avoid the same three to ten popular tourist attractions often over-hyped on the internet. Four out of five of my travelers planned trips based on word-of-mouth from other tourists who had been to the area or by asking locals, such as Airbnb hosts, what destinations they recommended. Most of my travelers wished to plan their travels to be more efficient about transportation time between tourist spots.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I also surveyed 17 travelers to learn about their travel planning pains and the planning tools that they used. The survey results reveal that their most frustrating pain point is paying for expensive tourist attractions. Most of the respondents used Google Maps, Reddit, and Yelp to plan their trips.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Other popular feedback included users needing the ability to easily distinguish the filter button for sorting traveling destinations and the ability to distinguish comments made by travelers versus comments made by locals.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">For the future of The Informed Traveler, I may consider updating the UI of the app to give it more personality and enjoyment for the users.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Traveling can be a very rewarding experience, even lifechanging, but planning for meaningful travels are difficult when the top search results for travel destinations are often populated by expensive, well known places.
                    <br><br>The Informed Traveler is a mobile travel app that allows travelers to create travel plans by selecting from unique traveling destinations. Travelers can inform their selection of a travel destination by reading reviews from locals in that area and travelers who have been to that destination.</p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I observed that travelers were having trouble and spending too much time picking unique locations to
                visit for
                their travels. These locations tended to be overpriced and the same basic tourist experience recommended
                by
                almost every travelling website. How might I create a travel planning app so that travelers can easily
                and
                quickly find authentic experiences that fit within their budget and vacation time?</p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>

            <p>In order to create a travel planning app to meet travelers’ needs, I first needed to conduct more research through user interviews and a survey in order to determine what travelers currently found painful about the travel planning process and how they felt about travel planning tools that they were already using.</p>

            <h4>Survey Results</h4>
            <img class="survey-image" src="/images/IFT/IFT-pain-survey.PNG" alt="Travel Planning Pains Results">

            <p>I want you to meet Miriam Garcia, a sharp and highly individualistic traveler, who was born from the interview and survey results. Miriam just received her Master’s degree and wishes to celebrate by traveling abroad. Miriam’s previous experience with travel planning is searching for unique travel destinations only to find overpriced tourist traps, so she is understandably frustrated. It's time for her to easily find and plan an authentic traveling experience.</p>
            <h4>User Persona: Miriam Garcia</h4>
            <img src="/images/IFT/IFT-user-persona.PNG" alt="Miriam Garcia">

            <br><br>
            <p>By carefully considering my targeted users and their needs through Miriam, I can form the problem that my travel app must solve.</p>

        <!-- Definition -->
        <!-- <div class="ift-definition ift-section">
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>Miriam can easily plan which stops she wishes to make on her trips with the aid of search engines and reviews online, but only the most popular tourist attractions show up in the results or are recommended by other travelers, which causes Miriam great frustration. I need to give Miriam an easier way to view authentic, local-approved traveling experiences without having to dig through the internet to find them.</p>

        <!-- <div class="ift-ideation ift-section">
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>Now that I have formed Miriam’s problem into an actionable statement, I can begin to come up with ideas for a solution. I organized potential ideas that I had based on what I thought would have the greatest impact on the user and would fit into the amount of time that I had given myself to design the app. I decided on designing a review system for travel destinations as well as a way to filter travel destinations by personal preferences</p>

            <p>With a better sense of what my app should be able to provide to my users, I mapped out the journey that Miriam will take throughout The Informed Traveler. Miriam is searching for destinations in Costa Rica to visit, but finds that she is finding the same top ten popular locations to visit. She finds an ad for The Informed Traveler and decides to give it a try. Miriam finds that she can easily plan a trip filled with authentic experiences thanks to The Informed Traveler.</p>

These actions are the features that I had prioritized: interacting with a review system and sorting authentic travel experiences by personal preference.</p>
            <h4>User Flow</h4>

            <p>After I had my user flow completed, I created wireframes for The Informed Traveler to ensure that my app was easy to navigate and clear to use.</p>
            <h4>Digital Wireframes</h4>

            </div>

            <p>After testing my wireframes on five users, I found that users needed to distinguish the personal preferences filter from other buttons and that favorable reviews left by locals needed to be highlighted from reviews left by travelers.</p>

            <h4>Analyzing feedback to Prioritizing Fixes</h4>

            <p>Using this feedback, I iterated on my user flow.</p>

            <p>I updated my wireframes using the feedback I had received and also applied some images to give my app a more polished look. What resulted is the following hi-fi prototype:</p>

            <p>My takeaway from this experience is to not get caught up in feature creep. I feel like I have spent a lot of time thinking about all the features that I could include in the app when I had already narrowed down that list based on feedback from user interviews and user testing. While making prototypes, I kept thinking of more features to place into the app, but I needed to focus more on the features prioritized. <br><br> For future projects, I will focus more on prioritized features. I will also try to remember to iterate as early and often as I can so that I do not get too caught up in one idea for a project.</p>
