                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Today students often get distracted watching entertainment apps like TikTok and Netflix instead of studying. Inspired by TikTokâ€™s bite-sized yet memorable videos accompanied by catchy song bits, my team and I wanted to design a music and education app to help students have fun studying by creating study jingles. Our app would be named Edubeat (to help students "beat" education by using music). We gave ourselves a timeline of three weeks to create this app using the following process:</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">To proceed any further, we needed to understand the student we were designing for. How would they feel about creating study jingles? What daunts them about creating lyrics or music to study? Have they even considered using music as a study method? We needed to conduct user research!</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">We did not think there were many, but to test our assumption, we conducted a survey asking learners if they have used music as a study tool and would be interested in creating music.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">As our survey revealed, the answer is not many people consider using music to study. With this information in mind, we revised the interview questions. What could be blocking students from using music as a studying tool? Also, how do they prefer to study, and what apps do they use to do so? We could really learn from what other education apps are doing well for our users.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Five interviews later, we found that our students had not considered creating songs to use as study material due to how time-consuming and complex they believe creating them would be. Despite this finding, several of our interviewees were interested in using an app that makes creating study music easier.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">We also learned that most of our users used education apps like Quizlet for creating virtual flashcards and Notability to review their notes. Our students appreciated the ease of using Quizlet and the personability of Notability. Perhaps we could incorporate these elements into Edubeat...</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">When making the journey map, my teammate wondered: What if Gina had to memorize the recipes for multiple drinks? Would Gina not feel overwhelmed with creating so many jingles? What if someone else using Edubeat had already created a jingle for memorizing one of the drinks that Gina also needs to know? After some discussion, we decided that Gina's journey through Edubeat should include browsing other studentsâ€™ jingles on our app to make her studying more efficient.</p>

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">We decided that Gina should have her own library to keep track of the jingles she creates, as we observed from Quizlet's library of study sets.

                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">While creating our user flow, we briefly lost sight of Gina due to feature creep. The way that we envisioned the jingle creation process would work, as detailed in the user flow above, starts with the following steps:</p>                
            </div>

                <ol class="caseList col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
                    <li>Choose the subject studied and the topic of that subject (Eg. If Gina was studying for a quiz on exponents, Math would be the subject and Algebra would be the topic)</li>

                    <li>Title your jingle, Describe the purpose of the jingle, Enter lyrics for the jingle</li>

                    <li>Choose to either upload your own instrumental track to layer the lyrics on top of or choose from tracks available from Edubeat</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">It is in this third step that my teammates and I saw an opportunity for another persona.

Although the record menu navigation was unique, I agreed that it was overbearing. Another reminder that we must not get too attached to our ideas in the UX worldâ€¦</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-10 offset-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Instead, I created an equally fun cassette tape-inspired main navigation menu that fits the retro theme while not over-occupying space.</p>
