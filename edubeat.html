This iPhone is surrounded by a notebook with flowers on its cover, a yellow candle, a sky blue circular mat, a dark blue pen, and a pink stick note pad.">

            <p>Today’s students often get distracted watching entertainment apps like TikTok and Netflix instead of studying. Inspired by TikTok’s bite-sized yet memorable videos that are often accompanied by catchy song bits, my team and I wanted to design a music and education app to help students have fun studying by creating study jingles. Our app would be named Edubeat (to help students “beat” education by using music). We gave ourselves a timeline of three weeks to create this app using the following process:</p>

            <img src="/images/EB/Design Process - Edubeat.png" alt="A diagram showing the design process I followed. The process begins with user research, which is represented by an icon of a person, to defining a problem, which is represented by a magnifying glass icon, to ideating a solution, represented by a lightbulb icon, to prototyping, represented by a mobile phone icon, and finally, to testing, which is represented by an icon of a comment bubble with ellipses in it.">

            <p>In order to proceed any further, we needed to understand the student we were designing for. How would they feel about creating study jingles? What daunts them about creating music to study? Have they even considered using music as a study method? We needed to conduct user research!</p>
        </div>

        <!-- User Research -->
        <div class="userResearch">
            <div class="caseHeading">
                <h3>User Research</h3>
            </div>

            <!-- User Interview Planning -->
            <p>With the above questions in mind, I created the following list of questions to ask five students:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>What do people currently use when using music as a learning tool?</li>

                <li>How are people making decisions when using education apps?</li>

                <li>What experiences have people had while using music as a learning tool?</li>

                <li>How do people feel when they use music as a learning tool?</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Survey -->
            <p>However, I withheld from asking these questions after reviewing them with my other team members. Just think, how many students do you know of who actually use music as a learning tool?</p>

            <p>We didn’t think there were many, but to test our assumption, we conducted a survey asking learners if they have used music as a study tool and would be interested in creating music.</p>

            <div class="ebPieChart">
                <img src="/images/EB/Edubeat_Survey_Pie_Chart.jpg" alt="A pie chart titled 'Best Methods to Recall Information'. There are 60 total responses. There are five sections to this pie chart: 'Writing It Down' (representing a red section of the chart) with 32 responses, 'Singing a Jingle' (representing an orange section of the chart) with 8 responses, 'Repetitive Studying' (representing a light blue section of the chart) with 18 responses, 'Teaching' (representing a tan colored section of the chart) with 1 response, and 'Reading Out Loud' (representing a yellow colored section of the chart) with 1 response.">

                <p class="caption">Only 8 out of the 60 learners surveyed found singing a jingle the best way to retain information</p>
            </div>

            <p>As our survey revealed, the answer is not many people consider using music as a study tool. With this information in mind, we revised the interview questions. What could be blocking students from using music as a studying tool? Also, how do they prefer to study and what apps do they use to do so? We could really learn from what other education apps are doing correctly for our users.</p>

            <!-- Interview and Survey Results -->
            <p>Five interviews later, we found that our students revealed that they hadn’t considered creating songs to use as study material due to how time consuming and complex they believe creating songs would be. Despite this fact, several of our interviewees were interested in using an app that would make creating study music easier.</p>

            <p>We also learned that most of our users were using education apps like Quizlet to easily create virtual flashcards and Notability to review their notes. Our students appreciated the ease of using Quizlet and the personability of Notability. Perhaps we could incorporate these elements into Edubeat…</p>

            <div class="userQuotes">
                <p class="quote"><i>"Have you ever tried opening a music software?? Those are so messy to look at... A music education app sounds cool though"</i> - Jess, 24</p>

            </div>

            <p>Ideally, we would want Edubeat to cater to learners of all ages, but then we wouldn’t be able to start solutioning with so many types of users in mind and with our limited time frame. Thanks to our user interviews, which were mainly performed on students in college, and my teammates’ empathy map, we narrowed down on a persona.</p>

            <!-- Empathy Map and User Persona -->
            <div class="ebEmpathyPersona">

            </div>

            <p>Introducing Gina. She’s a part-time college student who also works a part-time job as a bartender. Gina has a hard time remembering the recipe for a drink for her job. She always finds herself procrastinating by scrolling through Instagram and watching her TikTok feed instead.</p>

            <p>We can start forming Gina’s specific problem so we can help her. For instance, how could we help Gina study using Edubeat without sacrificing the fun she gets from entertainment apps?</p>

            <p>It was time to define Gina’s problem.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- Definition -->
        <div class="definition">
            <div class="caseHeading">
                <h3>Definition</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Gina's situation begged the question:</p>

            <p class="boldDefinition"><b>How might we design Gina’s experience so that she can retain and recall information that is studied, have a more efficient study session, and an overall more enjoyable and memorable experience?</b></p>

            <p>With a clear problem to solution for, we started to plan the design of our music education app, Edubeat.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Ideation -->
        <div class="ideation">
            <div class="caseHeading">
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
            </div>

            <p>To start answering our problem, one of my teammates mapped out what Gina’s journey through our app would look like.</p>

            <!-- Journey Map -->
            <div class="ebJourneyMap">
                <img src="/images/EB/Edubeat - Journey Map@2x.png" alt="A journey map for Gina which shows her scenario, goals, experience, and feelings during her experience with making a study jingle using Edubeat. Opportunities for satisfying Gina are also explored.">

                <p class="caption">Here's how Gina would feel while creating a jingle using Edubeat</p>
            </div>

            <p>Supposing the case that Gina had multiple drinks to memorize the recipes for, we felt that Gina would feel overwhelmed with creating so many jingles. As luck would have it, someone may have already created a jingle for memorizing one of the drink formulas that Gina needs to know. To make Gina’s studying more efficient, we decided that her journey should include browsing other students’ jingles on our app.</p>

            <!-- User Flow -->
            <p>Keeping this journey map in mind along with inspiration from other education apps that our interviewees had mentioned (like Quizlet), I created a user flow along with one of my other teammates.</p>

            <img src="/images/EB/Edubeat - User Flow.png" alt="A diagram showing the choices that Gina makes using Edubeat and the screens that she will reach">

            <p>This flow shows how Gina can accomplish the following tasks:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Create and sign in with an account</li>

                <li>Create a study jingle</li>

                <li>Browse study jingles</li>

                <li>Access her jingle library</li>

                <li>Manage her profile</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We decided that Gina should have her own personal library to keep track of the jingles she creates. We also wanted Gina to be able to manage her account to allow for some personability.</p>

            <p>While creating our user flow, we briefly lost sight of Gina and her problem that we were solving. The way that we envisioned the jingle creation process would work, as detailed in the user flow above, begins with the following steps:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Choose the subject studied and the topic of that subject (Eg. If studying for a quiz on exponents, Math would be the subject and Algebra would be the topic)</li>

                <li>Title your jingle, Describe the purpose of the jingle, Enter lyrics for the jingle</li>

                <li>Choose to either upload your own instrumental track to layer the lyrics on top of or choose form tracks available from Edubeat</li>
            </ol>

            <p>It is in this third step that my teammates and I saw an opportunity for another persona: a music composer who produces tracks for Edubeat to make available to users. This user would have the premium profile seen in the graphic above.</p>

            <p>Since we did not have enough time to deal with this additional persona, we had to revise our user flow to fit just Gina’s needs.</p>

            <div class="ebUserFlow">
                <img src="/images/EB/Edubeat - User Flow.png" alt="Our final user flow">

                <p class="caption">We translated Gina's emotional journey through our app into the more defined flow above</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Prototype -->
        <div class="prototype">
            <div class="caseHeading">
                <h3>Prototype</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Once we overcame creating our user flow, we realized that we had only a couple of weeks left to produce a hi-fidelity prototype (we had started working on this project late September and wanted to finish by mid-October).</p>

            <p>Normally I would rapidly produce a paper prototype to test on our users, but with the deadline approaching, I made low-fidelity wireframes to test on our users.</p>

            <!-- Low-fi wireframes -->
            <h1>A PLACEHOLDER UNTIL LOW-FI WIREFRAMES LINK FOUND</h1>

            <p>After testing our low-fi prototype, I created a list of feedback we had received from our users and reorganized them in order to figure out what issues we had to prioritize.</p>

            <!-- Testing Results -->
            <div class="ebLowTesting">

                    <p class="caption">We found that our users had issues with the layout and display of our app. They also requested more features like sharing jingles.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>As it turns out, our users wanted more interaction with the app by having lyrics highlighted while their study jingle was playing. Users also wanted to see the option for browsing other students’ jingles listed first on the home page so that users would be encouraged to save time studying by seeing if another learner had already created a jingle of the same study topic. Lastly, and most importantly, users were confused about the meaning of the text on certain buttons shown during the jingle creation process.</p>

            <div class="ebLowTestingEx">
                <img src="/images/EB/Home.png" alt="The home screen of Edubeat, which lists the following buttons for the users to tap: Create a study jingle, Browse jingles, and Upload an instrumental track (in this order)">

                <p class="caption">Users wanted to see "Browse pre-made jingles" listed before "Create a study jingle!"</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Final mid-fidelity prototype -->
            <p>After fixing the latter two issues, we jumped into creating our hi-fi prototype in Adobe XD. With the deadline breathing down our necks, we decided to focus solely on the UX aspect of our app and leave the more visual UI side and micro interactions for a later time when we could all meet again.</p>

            <p>I do wish we could have randomly selected potential users to interview instead of friends or family we knew, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, we could not freely approach anyone to interview for us. Post covid, I would love to interview students that I don’t know in order to get more fresh input.</p>

            <p><b>May - June 2021,<br>The journey continues</b></p>

            <p>In May, one of my team members and I were finally able to resume working on Edubeat. For this two month period, we wanted to work on the user interface of our app as it was rather lacking…</p>

            <p>First, we gathered inspiration from retro images and old music equipment. We found that the nostalgic feel of retro imagery could make users recall fun times they had studying when they were younger and less jaded by years of school.</p>

            <!-- UI Inspiration -->
            <div class="uiInspiration">
                <img src="/images/EB/Edubeat Inspo - Home.png" alt="An image of the first page of our UI Inspiration.">

                <p class="caption">
                    Retro images and colors galore called to Edubeat's old-school image
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Fueled by our inspiration, we created the following style guide:</p>

            <!-- Style Guide -->
            <div class="uiStyleGuide">
                <img src="/images/EB/Edubeat Style Tile.png" alt="An image of Edubeat's style guide">

                <p class="caption">Retro images and colors galore called to Edubeat's old-school image</p>
            </div>

            <p>I designed the buttons after rectangular push buttons on retro game consoles. As game consoles buttons are fun to use, we thought that users would find using the buttons enjoyable.</p>

            <!-- Main Navigation Fiasco -->

            <p>Next came repainting the old colors with the new colors and buttons from our Style Guide. Besides these updates, we also wanted to redo our main navigation to fit with our retro theme. While my teammate added graphics and updated the typography of our app, I created a main navigation menu inspired by our logo of a record player.</p>

            <div class="phoneDisplay">
                <img src="/images/EB/Menu 1 - Home.png" alt="Image of a phone screen with our record player navigation on the bottom">

                <p class="caption">Record main navigation menu is slick and fun, but at what cost?</p>
            </div>

            <p>As my teammate had pointed out, the main navigation takes up almost a fourth of the user’s screen, which is edging too much into the limited space we have for Edubeat’s features. Although the record menu navigation was a cool idea, I agreed that it was rather overbearing. Another reminder that we must not get too attached to our ideas in the UX world…</p>

            <p>Instead, I created an equally fun cassette tape inspired main navigation menu that fit the retro theme while not over occupying space.</p>

            <div class="phoneDisplay">
                <img src="/images/EB/Menu Background – 1.png" alt="Image of the cassette tape main navigation">

                <p class="caption">A much less space consuming, yet fun main navigation menu</p>
            </div>

            <p>After applying our style guide and the buttons I had made to the last of our screens, we made our first version of an Edubeat hi-fi prototype.</p>

            <!-- Misunderstandings and Adding Animations -->
            <p>Interviewing five more users revealed that most of them were confused about the meaning of the text on certain buttons and also desired more animations to better demonstrate the functionality of our app.</p>

            <div class="phoneDisplay">
                <img src="/images/EB/Jingle Creation - MG vs self upload – v4.png" alt="A screen of the 'premade' jingle misunderstanding, or is it?">

                <p class="caption">Users were confused about what exactly "premade" jingle meant. Was it a jingle they had already made, thus "premade"?</p>
            </div>

            <p>With the button text changed, I focused on making Edubeat more enjoyable and memorable as we had defined in our problem by making animations that conveyed how the app would function.</p>

            <div class="phoneDisplay">
                <img src="/images/EB/Jingle Creation - Start Recording - v4 – 11.png" alt="A screen showing the beginning of the recording process">

                <p class="caption">I finally added an animation that highlights scrolling lyrics while a track is played</p>
            </div>

            <p>I finally followed up on creating an animation highlighting lyrics as they played in real time while a jingle is playing. Since Edubeat is designed like a music recording device, I made the lyrics player look like a VCR screen.</p>

            <p>After applying these changes, we had our latest version of our hi-fi prototype.</p>

            <p>We pitched our latest version of the Edubeat prototype in the Next Level contest. (Youtube video below) Although we did not win the contest, we did receive feedback for Edubeat.</p>

            <p>For our next steps, we want to create a coded prototype of Edubeat and also consider updating Edubeat to include an older learner persona. We wish to continue working on Edubeat and pitching it in hopes that it will one day benefit learners everywhere.</p>

            <p>Thank you for reading!</p>
